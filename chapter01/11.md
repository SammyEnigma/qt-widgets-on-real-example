# What else

As said for the first Alpha version we need a crop function. The user should be able to
enable cropping from some action in the tab bar or menu. When the crop is enabled user
should be able to draw by dragging mouse cursor a rectangle on the current
frame. After releasing the mouse cursor user should be able to adjust drawn
rectangle, and on "Enter" key pressing crop function should crop all frames
in the GIF. Interesting, isn't it?
