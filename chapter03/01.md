# Chapter 3

As you can saw operations like open, save and crop in GIF editor, described in
chapter 1, can long very much. And during these processes UI is frozen. This is sad.
Why not add some busy animation during these operations? Good! But animations should
work in the main thread. Well, we can dilute code of operations with `QApplications::processEvents()`,
and move Magick++ operations in a separate thread. Amazing, let's do it.

Want to add that multithreading, especially in GUI, is not a panacea. I saw in my
practice that very much amount of threads in the application can only slow down the
performance, and very much. But the approach described above sounds very good. Our
application will be very responsive.

In Qt there are a lot of mechanisms of multithreading, like `QThread`, `QThreadPool`,
`QRunnable`, `QtConcurrent`, queued connections of signals and slots. So let's look
at the implementation.
